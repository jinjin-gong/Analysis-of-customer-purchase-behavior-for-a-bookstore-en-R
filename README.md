A) Context and Objective

Lapage, initially a physical bookstore, launched an online sales platform two years ago to meet the growing demand from its customers. The primary goal of this project is to analyze the performance of this online sales channel and gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior.

The analyses are divided into two main focus areas:

Sales Performance Analysis: Identify key metrics, KPIs, and evaluate sales performance to guide commercial strategy.

Customer Behavior Analysis: Study customer data to understand their online shopping habits and compare these behaviors with those observed in physical stores.

B) Methodology

To meet the companyâ€™s needs, the following steps were undertaken:

Data Preparation:

Cleaning and structuring the data provided in files.
Ensuring the quality and consistency of the information (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.).
Sales Performance Analysis:
Calculation of key KPIs (revenue, sales volume, average cart size).
Analysis of sales trends over time to identify periods of high activity.
Segmentation of sales by product category, region, and channel.

Customer Behavior Analysis:

Segmenting customers based on purchase frequency, average cart size, and loyalty.
Studying online behaviors: analyzing purchase recurrence and abandonment rates.
Comparing with data from physical stores to detect similarities and differences.

Statistical Tests and Correlations:

Analyzing correlations between different variables (e.g., average cart size and product type).
Conducting statistical tests to validate hypotheses about differences between customer segments.
Visualization and Communication of Results:
Using clear and precise graphics to present the analyses.
Summarizing key results in a synthetic dashboard format.

C) Results and Recommendations

Sales Performance:

Revenue: A steady increase in sales was observed, with significant peaks during holiday periods.

Best-Selling Products: Fiction books and stationery items dominate sales.

Regional Performance: Urban areas significantly outperform rural areas.

Customer Behavior:

Regular customers account for a significant portion of total sales, highlighting the importance of loyalty.

A substantial segment of customers purchases only during promotional periods.

Online data shows a strong correlation between time spent on the website and the average cart size.

Strategic Recommendations:

Strengthen promotional offers to attract more customers during slow periods.
Implement targeted loyalty campaigns for regular customers.
Optimize the user experience on the website to reduce abandonment rates and improve conversions.
