**A) Context and Objective**

**Context:** 
  
Lapage, initially a physical bookstore, launched an online sales platform two years ago to meet the growing demand from its customers. The primary goal of this project is to analyze the performance of this online sales channel and gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior.
  
**Objectif:** 
  
The analyses are divided into two main focus areas:

  - Sales Performance Analysis:
    Identify key metrics, KPIs, and evaluate sales performance to guide commercial strategy.
  - Customer Behavior Analysis:
    Study customer data to understand their online shopping habits and compare these behaviors with those observed in physical stores.

**B) Methodology**

To meet the companyâ€™s needs, the following steps were undertaken:
  ```
  1) Data Preparation:
     - Cleaning and structuring the data provided in files.
     - Ensuring the quality and consistency of the information (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.).
     - Familiarity with advanced Excel techniques (e.g., pivot tables, VLOOKUP, macros)

  2) Sales Performance Analysis:   
     - Calculation of key KPIs (revenue, sales volume, average cart size).
     - Analysis of sales trends over time to identify periods of high activity.
     - Segmentation of sales by product category, region, and channel.

  3) Customer Behavior Analysis:
     - Segmenting customers based on purchase frequency, average cart size, and loyalty.
     - Studying online behaviors: analyzing purchase recurrence and abandonment rates.
     - Comparing with data from physical stores to detect similarities and differences.

  4) Statistical Tests and Correlations:
     - Analyzing correlations between different variables (e.g., average cart size and product type).
     - Conducting statistical tests to validate hypotheses about differences between customer segments.

  5) Visualization and Communication of Results:
     - Using clear and precise graphics to present the analyses.
     - Summarizing key results in a synthetic dashboard format.
  ```
**C) Results and Recommendations**
